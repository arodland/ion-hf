# Ion HF, the program

`ionhf` (`crates/ionhf`) is the Ion modem as a desktop program. Programs
use it through a VARA-style host interface: Winlink clients (Pat, Winlink
Express) for links, and group chat such as Ragtime's for broadcast groups.
Its window shows the modem; chat, files and nets belong to the programs on
top. It drives the radio over TCI
(ExpertSDR / SunSDR), Icom CI-V, Kenwood / Elecraft / Yaesu CAT or Hamlib
`rigctld`, or uses a sound card alone with PTT by CAT, RTS, DTR or VOX.

```text
ionhf [--loopback] [--loop-snr DB] [--tci ws://host:port] [--connect CALL]
      [--setup] [--shots DIR] [--quit S]
```

- `--loopback`: no radio; simulated stations answer (below). `--loop-snr`
  sets the simulated channel's SNR (default 10 dB, the `loopback_snr_db`
  setting).
- `--tci`: use TCI at this address instead of the configured radio.
- `--connect`: call a station at start.
- `--setup`: start on Setup.
- `--shots DIR`, `--quit S`: save the window to `DIR` every 15 s and close
  after `S` seconds (screenshots, scripted checks).

## Settings

`ionhf.toml` holds the settings, `window.ron` the window, and `ion.log`
the log (written by a release build started without a terminal):

| System | Folder |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Ion HF` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Ion HF` |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ionhf`, else `~/.config/ionhf` |

**Portable:** with an `ionhf.toml` (even an empty one) next to the program,
Ion keeps everything in that folder instead.

## Window

| Screen | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Modem | S/N, Level, Rate and Data; the send progress while linked; the link's counts (Bursts, Frames, Resent, HARQ increments / recoveries, Lost codewords, Polls, Ctrl bursts, Air time, Allowed: the level the peer's reports allow); the open broadcast groups and who is heard in them; the band meter (how clean each third of the passband is here); the waterfall; the latest bursts and notes; **Disconnect** and **Abort** while linked. |
| Setup | Station (call, grid), Radio (link type, port, model, sound cards with **Rescan**; applies on restart), Levels (drive and the OFDM level), Keying (PTT, **TX audio** and lead time), Host (the VARA-style ports). |

## Winlink host interface

`crates/ionhf/src/host.rs` follows "VARA Protocol Native TNC Commands"
(2022): a command port (default 8300) and a data port one above, on
127.0.0.1 only, one client at a time. `VERSION` is answered
`VERSION IonHF <version>`. Settings that mean nothing to Ion (`BW…`,
`COMPRESSION …`, `CWID …`) are answered `OK`. `BUFFER n` counts bytes the
far end has not yet acknowledged (Pat waits for 0 before closing).
`DISCONNECT` closes the link once what is queued has been acknowledged
(a client's farewell still goes), giving up on the rest after 30 s;
`ABORT` closes at once.
`PTT ON/OFF` is for information only: Ion keys the radio itself. `SN`
gives the S/N of the last burst heard. `ABORT` also drops what broadcast
frames are queued.

Broadcast groups ([broadcast.md](broadcast.md)), as Data2G's host offers
them, on the KISS port 200 below the command port (8100):

| Command | Reply | |
|---|---|---|
| `BCAST OPEN group [FROM call]` | `BCAST PORT n` | a KISS port (1–15) for the group; the sender's call always goes |
| `BCAST CLOSE n` | `OK` / `WRONG` | |
| `BCAST MODE n ...` | `OK` / `WRONG` | `OK` for an open port: Ion picks the level |
| `MODES` | `MODE ION 2400 255 16 3.0 30.0`, `OK` | one mode, for a client sizing frames and timing repairs |

- Port 0 is the group "KISS 0" while a KISS client is connected.
- Frames: KISS data (command 0) on the group's port, or ACKMODE (0x0C,
  a 2-byte tag, then the frame); the tag comes back once the frame has
  gone out. KISS persistence (command 2) sets P for every group.
- Once the command client has sent a `BCAST` command it gets `BCAST n
  HEARD [call] snr` (a burst of the group, its call when its header
  decoded), `BCAST n LOST k` and `BCAST n DROPPED k`.
- When the command client goes, its groups close.

## On the air

A host program's `CONNECT` and broadcast frames key the radio, and so
does answering: with a call set, Ion answers a station that calls it while
no link is up (`answer = false` in `ionhf.toml` receives only). Disconnect
closes a link once what is queued has gone; Abort (Esc) stops it without
transmitting.

**Identification.** Ion sends a CW ID at least every 570 s during a link
and once at its end (§97.119). The station that did not close the link
waits for the other's CW ID plus 1.5 s before it transmits. Both ends time
the mid-link IDs from the same instant, so each waits out the other's ID
instead of polling into it (`cw_id_breaks_do_not_cost_polls` in
`crates/ion/tests/node.rs`).

**Radio notes.**

- TCI: Ion sets DIGU on connect. The RX filter is left to ExpertSDR3 and
  must pass 0–3000 Hz; a narrower one is reported as a problem.
- **TX audio** picks the input a CAT key takes on radios with two: Data
  (the default) keys a Kenwood with `TX1;` (DATA SEND, audio from USB or
  ACC2) and rigctld with `T 3` (Hamlib's data PTT); Mic keys `TX;` and
  `T 1`. A radio that refuses the data command gets the plain one. `TX;`
  keys Kenwood and Elecraft but is a read on Yaesu.
  Yaesu wants 2 stop bits on its older menus.
- The 0.2 s PTT-to-RF lead (`DEFAULT_LEAD_S`) has not been measured over
  TCI; sound-card radios set the lead under Keying.

## Loopback

`ionhf --loopback` runs Ion against a simulated station on a simulated
channel, with no radio:
the station `LOOP` answers calls and sends every line back ("LOOP
copies: ...").

## Simulated band

`ionhf --sim` runs headless Ion stations, no window and no radio, for
testing host programs such as Ragtime or Pat against Ion. Each station has
its own host ports: station 0 on 8300 (KISS 8100), station 1 on 8310 (KISS
8110), and so on. What one transmits reaches each of the others through
its own IONOS channel (`ion_dsp::ionos`), in real time.

```
ionhf --sim [--stations 2] [--ionos WGN|MPG|MPM|MPP|MPD] [--paths 2]
      [--snr 10[,DB...]] [--port 8300] [--calls N0AAA,N0BBB] [--seed 1]
```

`--snr` is what each station hears, in station order (the last value
repeats), against a sine at full transmit level in 3 kHz, as in the IONOS
charts; `--snr 15,0` makes a lopsided link. The log goes where Ion's log
goes, so run it from a folder with its own `ionhf.toml` (portable).

## Not in this version

- Calling CQ or beaconing.
- Setting the radio's frequency: the operator tunes the radio.
